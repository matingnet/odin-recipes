        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Before we start: what is real Italian pizza? American-style delivery pizza is nothing like Italian pizza. But just like any popular food, there are different styles of Italian pizza based on region and method. For example: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In Rome: </strong>There’s a Roman pizza chef called Bonci who’s made a name for himself making rectangular thick crust pizza with incredible bright colored toppings</li>
            <li><strong>In Naples: </strong>Naples is the birth place of pizza itself, and here the pizza crust is thin and supple! It’s covered in tangy tomatoes, often a simple pizza margherita.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Here's our definition of italian Pizza: </b>A pizza with simple flavors and a supple, thin crust, that’s cooked in a very hot oven. (This is also the definition we use for our Neapolitan pizza.) The recipe we’ll share below is elegantly simple: a perfect crust, tangy tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and a bright green homemade basil pesto. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Best Homemade Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Best Basil Pesto or Basil Cashew Pesto</li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the pizza dough</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</li>
            <li>Make the pizza sauce</li>
            <li><b>Prepare the cheese: </b>If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
            <li><b>Bake the pizza: </b>When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
            <li>Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
